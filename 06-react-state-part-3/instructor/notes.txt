1. Put each component into its own file

2. States and Props are NOT the same thing
  - State represents the state of our user interface.
    Any value in your component that will change uses state.
  - Props are supplied by parent components.
    Parents can change child component props, but components
    never change their own props.

3. States can only be changed by setState()
  - setState changes the virtual DOM
  - virtual DOM is diffed against actual DOM (on the browser)
  - React tells browser to change only what needs changing

4. Components that don't have state can be declared as Functional components
