# React Development Lessons

This project contains all of the lesson notes and pre-class code for every React Development Development session.

## Usage

  1. At the beginning of each cohort, fork this repo to the `bitmakerlabs` account and rename it to match the cohort (i.e. `react-january-2019`).
  2. Update your fork as necessary (e.g. remove / rearrange / rename lessons)
  3. Share that repo with the students so they can easily follow along with code examples in class.
  4. Commit your in-class code to the fork and push it so students have access to the final result for reference when reviewing the day's material.
